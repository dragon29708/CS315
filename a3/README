Description: README file for the kd appication (CS315 - Assignment 3).

Welcome to my kd app!

Instructors/Graders:

        Whats your goal?

        After unzipping the contents of my zip file to your working directory...

	1. To compile the kd app:
                .$: make
	2. To run the kd app:
		.$: make run
	3. Change seed or number of nodes?
		top of the makefile are the two variables to change

Application Description:

	1. Takes a parameter n, which should be a positive integer, indicating how
	many data points are to be placed in the tree, and a parameter p,
	indicating the number of probes into the tree.

	2. Reads from standard input a list of n 4-dimensional integer data points.

	3. Builds a k-d tree with those n values using the offline method, with
	b set to 10 (and ties going to the left subtree)

	4. Reads p 4-dimensional data values, called probes, and for each probe,
	lists all the data points stored in the bucket where the probe would be
	found if it were in the tree.

Contents list for proper app usage:

	[kd.cpp, kdTree.cpp, kdTree.h, kdNode.h, kdNode.cpp, randGen.pl, makefile, README]

	Contents notes:

		kd.cpp - main function for the app. Follows the app description step by step

		kdTree.(cpp/h) - K-D tree class prototype and implementation. See data
		and function members in the code for the best understanding.

		treeNode.(cpp/h) - K-D tree node with member functions that
		practically build the tree itself! For data members and

		makefile - some helpful commands for deving this app or
		running it.

		randGen.pl - a program to generate an appropriate stream of
		deterministic pseudo-random numbers in the range 0 .. SEED.
		This program, written in Perl, takes an optional parameter called seed.

App output:

	By default, the output will be stored in tmpRun.out in your
	working directory.
