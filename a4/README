Description: README file for the wordCount appication (CS315 - Assignment 4).

Welcome to my app!

Instructors/Graders:

        Whats your goal?

        After unzipping the contents of my zip file to your working directory...

	1. To compile:

                .$: make

    2. To run:

    			.$: make run

    3. To change the text file:

    			Open the makefile and change the DATA variable on line 8

Application Description:

	1. Takes a text file as an argument to the program.

	2. Reads all strings in the text file. (a string here is a continious set of non space chars)

	3. Stores all strings in a hash table

	4. Prints the strings in alphabetical order with their associted occurances (counts) in the file

	5. Prints the strings in order from highest num of occurances to least num of occurances

Contents list for proper app usage:

	[wordCount.cpp, wordHash.(cpp/h), LList.(cpp/h), node.(cpp/h), makefile, README]

	Contents notes:

		wordCount.cpp - main function for the app. Follows the app description step by step

		wordHash.(cpp/h) - hash class prototype and implementation. See data
		and function members in the code for the best understanding.

		LList.(cpp/h) - LList that are the elements of the hash table.

		node.(cpp/h) - LList node for the LList's in the hash table.

		makefile - some helpful commands for deving this app or
		running it.

App output:

	By default, the output will be stored in tmpRun.out in your
	working directory.
