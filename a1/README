Description: README file for the cards appication (CS315 - Assignment 1).

Welcome to my cards app!

Instructors/Graders:

        Whats your goal?

        After unzipping the contents of my zip file to your working directory...

	1. To compile the cards game:
                .$: make
	2. To run the cards game:
		.$: make run
	3. Change num(cards/turns/players)?
		top of the makefile are the three variables to change

Application Description:
	
	Cards is a game app developed as Assignment 1 for CS315 Spring 2020.
	Cards purpose was to implement a doubly-linked list as the data
	structure for card decks in a card game with multiple players.
	
	Cards Rules:
		Each of n players starts with c cards arranged in a pile.
		These cards have value 1 ... c, with the 1 card on the top.
		The weight of the pile is the sum of d*v, where d is the depth
		of each card (starting at 1) and v is its value. So the
		starting weight of each pile is 
		1*1 + 2*2 + ... + c*c = c(c+1)(2c+1)/6. Higher-weight piles
		are worse; the goal is to have 0 weight, that is, no cards at all.

		At each turn, someone tosses an n-sided die, which indicates
		which player p will have the advantage on this turn. Player p
		tosses a 2-sided die, indicating whether to discard a card
		from the top (if the die shows 1) or the bottom of its pile
		(if the die shows 2), and an n-sided die, indicating which
		player accepts the discarded card. It is possible for p to get
		its own card back. The recipient puts the accepted card at the
		top of its pile.

		The winner is the first player to have an empty pile. If after t
		turns, no player has won, then the player whose pile has the
		smallest weight wins. If there is a tie, the lowest-numbered
		player with the smallest weight wins.

Contents list for proper app usage: 
	
	[cards, cards.cpp, LList.cpp, LList.h, node.cpp, node.h, randGen.pl, makefile, README]

	Contents notes:
		
		cards.cpp - main source for the app that includes main{}

		node.(cpp/h) - node class that simulates cards		

		LList.(cpp/h) - doubly-linked list class that simulates a
		deck of cards.

		makefile - some helpful commands for deving this app or
		running it.

		randGen.pl - a program to generate an appropriate stream of
		pseudo-random numbers in the range 0 .. 231â€’1. This program,
		written in Perl, takes an optional integer parameter to seed
		the random-number generator if you want reproducable results.	

Game output:
	
	By default, the output of the game will be stored in tmpRun.out in your
	working directory.
